# Algorithms

In this repository I upload my solutions for programming exercises from the book Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
This is a personal project where I my goals are to work through the book and to learn Rust.

Note that I am a Rust beginner so my solutions may be suboptimal. Comments for corrections are welcome!

## Structure

Each exercise is implemented in their own module in which I also provide documentation and unit tests. Run all tests with `cargo test` or for individual exercises with `carg test <module_name>`.
The documentation provides a quick way to browse and view all exercises. Use `cargo doc --open` to view them. To show that the exercise has been solved, the doc comments for each exercise contain example code that is executed alongside all tests.
